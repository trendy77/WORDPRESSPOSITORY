Shortcodes

Shortcodes allow you to define a macro that expands to something of your choice. They're basically a sort of HTML tag that wraps content and accept attributes. For example, you could put this in post content:

  [my-shortcode foo="bar"]Hello, World![/my-shortcode]

              //**    BECOMES:

  <aside data-foo="bar"> <h3>Hello, World!</h3></aside>

                       if you include the code below in your `functions.php` file, you can create a post with the following content:
// IN FUNCTIONS.PHP

function css_tricks_example_shortcode( $attrs, $content = null ) {
    extract( shortcode_atts( array(
        'twitter' => ''
    ), $attrs ) );
    $twitterURL = 'https://twitter.com/' . $twitter;
    return <<<HTML
<p>This post has been written by $content. Follow him on Twitter</p>
HTML;
}
add_shortcode( 'author', 'css_tricks_example_shortcode' );
